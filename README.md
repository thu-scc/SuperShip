# SuperShip: GPU End-to-End Inference Optimization

This repository is the public code package for the SuperShip competition task. It contains the fixed RT-DETRv4 source, the official baseline inference weight, and the reference timing/scoring tools. The public dataset is distributed separately through Tsinghua Cloud.

The full competition rules are available in [COMPETITION.md](COMPETITION.md).

The upstream RT-DETRv4 source is pinned to commit:

```

See [UPSTREAM_README.md](UPSTREAM_README.md) for the original RT-DETRv4 documentation and [LICENSE](LICENSE) for the upstream license.
Machine-readable release metadata and checksums are stored in [RELEASE_INFO.json](RELEASE_INFO.json).

## Public Data

| Split | Images | Instances | Released content |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Train | 2,405 | 11,904 | Images and COCO annotations |
| Validation | 1,030 | 4,576 | Images and COCO annotations |
| Public reference | 200 | 519 | Images, inference metadata, and COCO ground truth |

The public reference split is selected deterministically by sorting the private test-pool images by integer `image_id` and taking the first 200. After installing the data package, its manifest is available at `data/SuperShip/reference/split_manifest.json`.

The remaining 4,300 hidden-test images, metadata, and annotations are not included in this repository.

### Download and install

Download `SuperShip-public-data-v2.tar.zst` from the [Tsinghua Cloud link](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/d/da024b91e33a46cb8200/). Its expected SHA-256 is:

```text
4f70f1167ee51090e30f5f3c4915f821b2c960d307610902ad666ae92ea69b71
```

Install an archive already downloaded to the local machine:

```bash
bash download_data.sh /path/to/SuperShip-public-data.tar.zst
```

Alternatively, use a direct-download URL:

```bash
SUPERSHIP_DATA_URL='<THU_CLOUD_DIRECT_DOWNLOAD_URL>' bash download_data.sh
```

The script verifies the archive checksum, extracts it under `data/SuperShip/`, and runs the release integrity check. It requires `curl` for URL downloads and `zstd` for extraction.

```

## Environment

The official evaluation device is one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090. Python 3.11 is recommended.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install a PyTorch build compatible with the CUDA driver on the target system if the generic requirement does not select the desired build.

## Baseline Inference

Run one-shot inference on the public reference split:

```bash
python3 supership/generate_submission.py \
  --config configs/dfine/dfine_hgnetv2_s_supership.yml \
  --weights weights/baseline.pth \
  --img-folder data/SuperShip/reference/images \
  --ann-file data/SuperShip/reference/reference_images_meta.json \
  --output output/reference_submission.json \
  --device cuda:0 \
  --batch-size 8
```

Score the result:

```bash
bash score_reference.sh output/reference_submission.json
```

The validation baseline reported by the organizer is `AP50 = 0.916`.

## End-to-End Timing

The competition protocol separates untimed initialization from timed inference:

1. The organizer starts `bash run.sh --worker` without exposing evaluation paths.
2. The worker loads the model, initializes CUDA, then prints `THU_RS_READY`.
3. The timer starts immediately before the organizer sends input/output paths over stdin.
4. Timing stops after all images are processed, the output is flushed with `fsync`, and the worker exits.

Run the same protocol locally on the 200-image public reference split:

```bash
bash benchmark_reference.sh
```

The default is three independent runs. Results are written to:

```text
output/reference_submission.run1.json
output/reference_submission.run2.json
output/reference_submission.run3.json
```

Score all generated runs:

```bash
bash score_reference.sh
```

Environment overrides are supported:

```bash
BATCH_SIZE=16 RUNS=3 DEVICE=cuda:0 bash benchmark_reference.sh
```

## Training

The released training and validation data use COCO Detection format. Train or fine-tune with:

```bash
python3 train.py \
  --config configs/dfine/dfine_hgnetv2_s_supership.yml \
  --tuning weights/baseline.pth \
  --device cuda:0
```

Use representative training samples for post-training quantization calibration. The validation split should remain reserved for model selection and accuracy evaluation.

## Accuracy Scoring

The scoring tool can evaluate any COCO result array against a released split:

```bash
python3 supership/score_submission.py \
  --gt data/SuperShip/val/annotations/instances_val.json \
  --submission output/val_submission.json
```

Official ranking is performed by the organizer on the unreleased 4,300-image hidden test set.

Predictions with non-positive width or height are accepted but cannot match any
ground-truth object. They remain in confidence ranking and COCO `maxDets`
selection as unmatched detections; they are not silently removed. Malformed
JSON, invalid IDs, non-finite numbers, and scores outside `[0, 1]` are rejected.
The reported `0.916` baseline is for validation, not the public reference split.

Worker processes must finish their child tasks and close the output before
completion. The Linux timing tool waits for remaining processes in the worker
process group within the run timeout, including that time in the measurement.
Failure or timeout terminates the process group. Workers must not detach tasks
into a separate session or process group.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```
